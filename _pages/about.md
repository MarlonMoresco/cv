I am a highly motivated and knowledgeable postdoctoral fellow at Concordia University. I am working on developing robust risk measures and risk measurement techniques for natural catastrophe insurance under [Melina Mailhot](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/melina-mailhot.html) and [Silvana Pesenti](https://utstat.toronto.edu/pesenti/). My expertise lies in the field of finance, and I have a deep understanding of the axiomatic approach to risk measures.

From 2019 to 2022, I was a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, where I honed my skills and knowledge in the field. I also have a BSc and an MSc in business, providing a strong foundation for my current work.

My research has received recognition in the academic community and has been published in several prestigious international journals, including Statistics & Risk Modeling, Operations Research Letters, Annals of Operations Research, Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, and Statistics & Probability Letters. I have also presented my work at several conferences, such as PARTY and EBFIN, showcasing my knowledge and contributions to the field.

In addition to my research work, I am passionate about education and have experience in teaching and mentoring university students. I have served as a teaching assistant for several semesters in an Investments Portfolio course and as a tutor in a Business Analytics MBA program, where I taught various subjects on statistics and R programming. I am dedicated to helping students understand complex financial concepts and develop the skills they need to succeed in the industry.

I am a results-driven individual who is dedicated to finding solutions to complex financial problems. With my extensive knowledge and experience in finance, I am confident in my ability to make a positive impact in the industry and contribute to financial growth and stability

I am a finance Professor at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). My expertise lies in the field of finance, and I have a deep understanding of the axiomatic approach to risk measures.

 In 2023 I was a postdoctoral fellow at Concordia University, where I worked on developing robust risk measures and risk measurement techniques for natural catastrophe insurance under [Melina Mailhot](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/melina-mailhot.html) and [Silvana Pesenti](https://utstat.toronto.edu/pesenti/).

From 2019 to 2022, I was a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, where I honed my skills and knowledge in the field. I also have a BSc and an MSc in business, providing a strong foundation for my current work.

My research has received recognition in the academic community and has been published in several prestigious international journals, including Mathematics of Operations Research, Statistics & Risk Modeling, Operations Research Letters, Annals of Operations Research, Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, and Statistics & Probability Letters. I have also presented my work at several conferences, such as Bachelier, PARTY and EBFIN, showcasing my knowledge and contributions to the field.
